# CUDA Corner Detection - Shi Tomasi

More info coming soon!

## Usage

    ./goodfeatures [-v,-vv] <full path to the image> [sigma] [windowsize] [sensitivity]

**flags:**
 - h: show this help menu
 - v: output basic execution information
 - vv: output all information... good for debugging

**arguments:**

 - sigma: the sigma value for the Gaussian distribution used to form the convolution mask
 - windowsize: the size of a pixel 'neighborhood' in an image
 - sensitivity: determines the amount of features to detect... can be 0.0 to 1.0
